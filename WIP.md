# WIP.md

This file represents what needs to be done.

- complete starter event (currently softlocks)

- add most of the storyline (currently mirrors Pokemon Crystal, aside from the areas in New Bark Town)

- add the Jirachi events (remember: don't make Jirachi talk in English)

- change the encounters in Route 31 back from 100% Jirachi encounters
